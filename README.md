# algorithms-data-structures

This repository contains the implementation of algorithms and data structures that I'm learning at university. 

The language used in the course is C, so it is my main focus and will be the most complete. Rust is for personal challenge and because I love it!. For Go well... I don't actually have an explanation on why I used Go as well.
